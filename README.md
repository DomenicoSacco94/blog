# What is this repo about?

I would like to experiment with 11ty and quickly create my own personal web page from scratch.

## Why not using React, Vue or other libraries/frameworks?

Inspired by [this](https://infrequently.org/2024/11/if-not-react-then-what/) article, I decided to try with the simplest possible approach for the creation of a static website.

I also love the idea of NOT having to style each single page of the application, letting the `.md` files do that job for me.
