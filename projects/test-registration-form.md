## Description
This project was created from Create React App (v5.0.1). This package provides a fast way to implement and deploy a React application. Create-react-app does not provide any additional CSS libraries, its users are free to implement vanilla CSS styling (like in this case) or install tailwind, bootstrap and any other styling library as additional dependency.
